# Assignment 4: File Handling in Python  

This repository contains my work for **Assignment 4 – File Handling**.  
The goal of this assignment was to practice reading from and writing to text files using Python.  



## Files in this Repository
- `ANSWERS.py` – Python script that reads input from a text file and writes the output to another file.  
- `input.txt` – Sample input file containing the data used by the script.  
- `output.txt` – File generated after running the Python program (contains the results).  



## How the Program Works
1. Reads data from `input.txt`.  
2. Performs simple processing (counting words/lines, or any required task).  
3. Saves the results into `output.txt`.
